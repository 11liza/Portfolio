      <h2>Let me introduce myself!</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Liza Tällgård, a passionate frontend developer student with a love for creating beautiful and functional websites. My journey in the world of web development started when I discovered the magic of transforming lines of code into stunning user interfaces that not only look great but also enhance the overall user experience.

      <p>
        I have a knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, which I acquired during my time as a student. My projects have allowed me to explore the endless possibilities of these technologies, and I'm thrilled to continue honing my skills as I embark on my professional career. While I may not have past experience, I bring fresh perspectives and an eagerness to learn and grow with each new opportunity.

        When I'm not immersed in coding, I cherish quality time with my family, especially my adorable daughter, who never fails to put a smile on my face. Cooking is another passion of mine, and I find joy in experimenting with new recipes, adding a dash of creativity to the process, much like coding! Whenever I get a chance, I unwind by watching TV shows and movies, drawing inspiration from different storytelling techniques that I can apply to my web development projects.

        In my pursuit of excellence in the world of frontend development, I'm currently dedicating most of my time to studying and undertaking various personal projects. I am always seeking opportunities to collaborate, learn from experienced developers, and contribute to exciting initiatives that align with my values and aspirations.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        My ultimate goal is to create impactful digital experiences that not only impress but also make a difference in people's lives. I believe that through innovation, empathy, and continuous learning, I can craft user-centric websites that leave a lasting positive impact on their users.
